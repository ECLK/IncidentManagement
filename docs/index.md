## Getting started

### Dependencies

#### BACKEND
  - Language: Python
  - Framework: Django

#### FRONTEND 
  - Language: Javascript
  - Framework: ReactJS

### Quick start: Use Docker-Compose 

#### BACKEND
1. Make sure Docker is installed and running.
2. Navigate to `/backend` directory on terminal.
3. Build the docker image
```bash
$ docker-compose build
```
4. Create and run a new docker container instance.
```bash
$ docker-compose up
``` 
<small>At the very first run django will start before mysql by which will result an error for django to start. Stop (`ctrl + c`) and re-run.</small>
5. Open a new terminal (window/tab), navigate to `backend` folder
6. Run the migration to populate the data tables
```bash
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py migrate
```
7. Create superuser account and enter information when prompted.
```bash
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py createsuperuser
```
8. Run the seeder to populate data on the DB.
```bash
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py loaddata category channel province district police politicalparty segment
```
9. In order to add predefined users, run users seeder.
```bash 
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py loaddata users
```
<small>You may skip this step to implement you own user hierarchy.</small>
10. Server now runs at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).


#### FRONTEND 
1. Make sure backend server is running.
2. Navigate to `/frontend` directory on terminal.
3. Build the docker image
```bash
$ docker-compose build
```
4. Create and run a new docker container instance.
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
6. Server now runs at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). 

This is production build, runs locally, therefore not development friendly. For development purposes try [Local Installation](#local-installation). 


### Local installation: for Development 

#### BACKEND
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and Mysql 8 installed. (for multiple versions you can use multiple environments with [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)).
2. Navigate to `/backend` directory on terminal.
3. Create new database and update database connection data on `/backend/src/settings.py` or `/backend/.env/` file.
4. Install all necessary python packages along with Django.
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run migrations for populate tables to DB.
```bash
$ python manage.py migate
```
6. Create superuser account and enter information when prompted.
```bash
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py createsuperuser
```
7. Run the seeder to populate data on the DB.
```bash
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py loaddata category channel province district police politicalparty segment
```
8. In order to add predefined users, run users seeder. <small>You may skip this step to implement you own user hierarchy.</small>
```bash 
$ docker-compose exec djangoapp python manage.py loaddata users
```
9. Run the server locally on port 8000 and point your web browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view swagger view for API implementation.
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
<small>Here you will now see only the public API list. You need to login on admin panel and visit back to baseurl (locally its: http://localhost:8000/) to see all API Endpoints</small>
10. Visit [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) and login using credentials of the superuser you created.

You may also use the [Docker-Compose implementation](#backend-1) for development, instead of these steps.

#### FRONTEND
1. Make sure Node is installed and then backend API server is running.
2. Set required configurations [Check configuration options]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/configuration.md %}).
3. Navigate to `/frontend` directory on terminal. 
4. Install required packages
```bash
npm install
```
5. Run the frontend server.
```bash
npm start
```
6. Server now runs at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
